    "biography": "I began my career as a School Teacher at Jaycees Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Erode. My journey in higher education started when I stepped in as a Lecturer at Muthayammal College of Arts and Science, Rasipuram, where I worked for two years. I then continued my service at K.S. Rangasamy College of Arts and Science, Tiruchengode – a golden period in my career that gave me immense exposure to the teaching field. I had the privilege of working there for nearly 10 years. Later, I served at Vellalar College for Women (Autonomous), Erode for six years. This is the place where I found the spark to create this blog and began posting videos to share knowledge with a wider audience. My journey then took me back to K.S. Rangasamy College of Technology, Tiruchengode, where I worked as a Technical Trainer in the Training and Placement Department. Currently, I am working as an Assistant Professor in the MCA Department at K.S. Rangasamy College of Technology.",
