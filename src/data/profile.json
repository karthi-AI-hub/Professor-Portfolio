    "biography": "I began my career as a School Teacher at Jaycees Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Erode. My journey in higher education started when I stepped in as a Lecturer at Muthayammal College of Arts and Science, Rasipuram, where I worked for two years. I then continued my service at K.S. Rangasamy College of Arts and Science, Tiruchengode – a golden period in my career that gave me immense exposure to the teaching field. I had the privilege of working there for nearly 10 years. Later, I served at Vellalar College for Women (Autonomous), Erode for six years. This is the place where I found the spark to create this blog and began posting videos to share knowledge with a wider audience. My journey then took me back to K.S. Rangasamy College of Technology, Tiruchengode, where I worked as a Technical Trainer in the Training and Placement Department. This role gave me the opportunity to explore my own learning skills while interacting with bright young minds. Currently, I am working as an Assistant Professor in the MCA Department at K.S. Rangasamy College of Technology. This role continues to inspire me to grow, learn, and contribute more meaningfully to the academic community.",
